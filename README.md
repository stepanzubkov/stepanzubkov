# Hi there, I'm Stepan Zubkov 👋

I'm a **student** and passionate coder, mostly working in **Python** but also exploring QML, Go, C, C++, Elixir, Bash, and Lua. I love using **GNU/Linux** and contribute to the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) community—especially by translating apps in my spare time.
